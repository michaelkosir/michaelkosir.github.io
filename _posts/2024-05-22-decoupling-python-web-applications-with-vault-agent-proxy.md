#### Abstract
In this talk I will discuss a common deployment pattern for virtual machine based Python web applications and provide a simple way for developers to incorporate static (KV-v2) and dynamic (database, cloud, PKI) secrets into their applications with Vault Agent. Additionally, I will show how Vault Proxy can be used to simplify the process of using Vault for Advanced Data Protection workflows.

Vault Agent and Vault Proxy aim to remove the initial hurdle of adopting Vault by providing a more scalable and simpler way for applications to integrate with Vault.
